Polymorphism - One single object behaving in many different forms in the given instance of time is called polyohorsim.

Method overriding in order to achive the compile time polyohorsim 
And run time polyohorsim 

Polymorphism --> method overriding --> runtime polymorphism 

We can use annotations such as @ Override  this understood it's coming from parent class

Override method is done only when a method is already present in parent class.
 
Inheritance - parent/ base/ super to Child/ derived/ sub

The process of acquiring the property from one class to another class.
It is always written with the class structure / class declaration .
We can use the extends inside of class .
Example - class ClassName extends A {
}
class A {
}

Is a relationship - inheritance 


Encapsulation - it encapsulates within the class and can only be accessed by the methods of the class
Has a relationship - encapsulation 
private keyword is used.
